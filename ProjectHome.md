It is fairly annoying to have to swap keyboards just because you need to change layout or language. A Honeycomb tablet can be used to emulate a keyboard with a customizable layout and then act as a HID to the computer.
A user may be able to get HTML and CSS customize
able control layouts, this could alter per program or, per laganguage settings.

The initial build will be HID emulation over Bluetooth on Honeycomb (if possible). One or two buttons will send just a few characters to the paired desktop computer. The next build will try to be compatible with USB, if the API allows it.

This could further be extended to act as a touchscreen for the desktop computer also.
